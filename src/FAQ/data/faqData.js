    {
      question: "How does Vistora ensure claim accuracy and fraud prevention?",
      answer:
        "Unlike traditional systems that rely heavily on manual review, Vistora uses a real time AI Verification engine trained on multilingual medical data (Hindi + English). It reviews claims instantly and flags anomalies with over 99% accuracy — saving time and reducing errors.",
    },
    {
      question: "How fast is your system compared to traditional verification?",
      answer:
        "Our decentralized backend processes thousands of claims per second at a fraction of the cost — often within seconds, not days. This is powered by next-gen infrastructure with built-in optimization for high-volume healthcare networks.",
